## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- Sass (Scss)
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid (implicitly in grid-based layout logic)
- CSS (Scss) with Variables and Mixins
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Font
- Responsive Design with Media Queries
- ARIA Accessibility Enhancements


### What I learned

Through completing this Order Summary Card challenge, I gained a deeper understanding of building responsive layouts with a mobile-first approach using SCSS and media queries. I strengthened my skills in using SCSS mixins to streamline repetitive styles, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. Additionally, working with ARIA attributes gave me insight into improving accessibility for users who rely on screen readers. This project also reinforced my experience with Flexbox for layout management and helped me integrate Google Fonts effectively to enhance typography. Overall, this challenge solidified my ability to structure semantic HTML5 markup alongside responsive, accessible design techniques.

### Continued development

I plan to build on the foundational skills gained from this challenge by exploring more complex layouts using CSS Grid, which will allow for even greater flexibility in structuring components. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of accessibility by integrating further ARIA roles and attributes to improve the user experience for all users, especially those relying on assistive technology. I also want to experiment with CSS custom properties alongside SCSS variables to create more dynamic themes, potentially enabling user-customizable color schemes. Finally, transitioning this design into a React component would be a valuable next step, as it would enable reusability and interactivity, preparing me for larger, more interactive projects in the future.
